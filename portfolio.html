        <h2>Gusto</h2>
        <p>Gusto was a group project developed at IUPUI's Summer Coding Camp. The game build is not available today, but
          the premise was to build a fighting game as fast as possible with what we already knew under short deadlines.
          The game used MSPaint and simple drawings, but featured several playable characters in this side to side

        <h2>Odyssey</h2>
        <p>Odyssey was a partner project developed at Rose-Hulman's Introductory Coding Course. The game features a hero
          with a spear who must fight off rooms full of monsters before facing a final boss. All animations, sprites,
          music, etc. were originally made. The game is fully playable and takes inspiration from older Legend of Zelda
          games.
